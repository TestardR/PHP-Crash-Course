When choosing between include and require :
Use include when you want the site to keep on running even tough the included file is not found
Use require when you want your app to crash if file not found

require_once : identical to require, except that php will check if it has already been included, if so, it won't include it again.

include('in/heander/php'); : you can add parenthesis, if you want to use a function format
